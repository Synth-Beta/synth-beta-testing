# Xcode Cloud Post-Clone Script
# This script runs IMMEDIATELY after the repository is cloned, BEFORE Swift Package Manager
# tries to resolve dependencies. This is critical for Capacitor apps where npm packages
# need to exist before SPM can resolve the local package paths.
#
# Execution order in Xcode Cloud:
# 1. Repository cloned
# 2. ci_post_clone.sh runs (THIS SCRIPT) ← Install npm dependencies here
# 3. Swift Package Manager resolves dependencies ← Needs node_modules to exist
# 4. ci_pre_xcodebuild.sh runs
# 5. xcodebuild runs

# Don't use set -e initially, we want to see all errors
# set -e  # Exit on error

# Enable verbose output for debugging
set -x

# Exit on error for critical commands
set -o pipefail
