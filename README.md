## Security

This application implements comprehensive security measures following OWASP best practices:

- **Rate Limiting**: IP + user-based rate limiting on all public endpoints (10-100 req/min depending on endpoint)
- **Input Validation**: Schema-based validation with type checking, length limits, and pattern validation
- **Input Sanitization**: XSS and injection prevention through input sanitization
- **API Key Security**: Secure key management with rotation support, no hard-coded keys
- **CORS Protection**: Strict origin validation in production
- **Error Sanitization**: Prevents information disclosure through error messages
- **Request Size Limits**: Prevents DoS attacks via large payloads (1MB limit)

See [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for detailed security policies and configuration.

## Quick Start

### Monorepo layout

| Path | App |
|------|-----|
| repo root | Consumer web (`join.getsynth.app`) |
| `apps/admin/` | Admin + marketing (`getsynth.app`, `/admin` unchanged) |
| `mobile/` | Expo app |
| `styleguide/` | Style guide site |

```bash
# Consumer app
npm install && npm run dev

# Admin portal (getsynth.app)
npm run admin:install && npm run admin:dev
```

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd plusone-event-crew
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Add your credentials to `.env.local`:
```env
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# JamBase API
VITE_JAMBASE_API_KEY=your_jambase_api_key

# Optional: Music Streaming
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:5174/auth/spotify/callback
VITE_APPLE_MUSIC_DEVELOPER_TOKEN=your_apple_music_token
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174) in your browser.

## Web vs Mobile

- **Web**: Run and deploy from the **root** of this repo. `npm run dev` starts the Vite dev server; the web app is deployed (e.g. to Vercel) from the root build. The website is unchanged and remains the primary web frontend.
- **iOS and Android**: Run and build from the **`mobile/`** directory using Expo. See [mobile/README.md](mobile/README.md) for:
  - How to run: `cd mobile && npx expo start` or `npx expo run:ios` / `npx expo run:android` (from repo root: `npm run mobile:start`)
  - Environment setup (use the same Supabase project as web)
  - Production builds via EAS (App Store / Play Store)
- **Web vs app screen parity** (for RN backlog): [mobile/PARITY.md](mobile/PARITY.md)
- **Root `ios/` and `android/`**: These are **Capacitor** (legacy) projects that wrap the web build for mobile. For new mobile development and store builds, use the Expo app in `mobile/` instead. The Capacitor folders are kept for reference or legacy workflows only.
